# AI-miss-u
By Estelle Ocran and Junior Garcia

A digital representation of your loved ones. 

## Description

The advent of machine learning and artificial intelligence has revolutionized our use of and interaction with technology. From recommender systems to self-driving cars, AI has permeated almost every aspect of our daily lives to the point where we are not even cognizant of its presence. One aspect we were interested in exploring is the effect AI has, and will continue to have, in rekindling human relationships. Although it feasible to envision a future where AI and technology acts as deterrent to human relationships due to the lack of interpersonal interactions that exists between humans, we envisioned a hopeful future where AI helps humans get closer together. The aforementioned aspiration resulted in **AI-miss-u**, a AR/VR digital representation of your loved ones. 

Using state-of-the-art AI algorithms, AI-miss-u takes in any of the following inputs from someone's loved one: text data, video data, or image data, to create an AR/VR digital representation that acts and talks exactly like your loved one. The more data you feed in, the more the digital representation will resemble your loved one. This digital representation can be accessed through any piece of technology with access to the Internet. To make the experience more immersive, users can customize  AI-miss-u so that they can access their loved one through your browser using Virtual Reality, your phone using Augmented Reality, through sms/messenger/whatshapp via the chatbot component, or all of the aforementioned. The idea is to give users the ability to customize their AI-miss-u experience to fit the communication method that best fits the type of relationship they have with their loved one. Using this product, users can bring back to life loved ones that have passed away, friends that are too far away, or even recreating digital representations of famous individuals.
